# Blessings Archive
Blessings Archive is a modification for Warhammer 40.000 Darktide that adds a custom screen where you can find all your unfitted blessings. Information about blessings includes: title, rarity, description, list of fitting weapon. Blessings are sorted by name and rarity, and you can further filter them down by weapon category and rarity.
